    <p>There is a widespread prejudice, almost an unconditional reflex, that affects current music. There is a clear line drawn by purists: on one side the &ldquo;Committed Rap&rdquo;, noble and socially useful; on the other the new urban wave, often labeled as superficial, guilty of not dealing with &ldquo;great themes&rdquo;.</p>
<p>And yet, looking beyond the surface and labels, this contrast has much older roots. It is not a question of beats or autotune, it is the same philosophical crossroads that Giacomo Leopardi crossed.</p>

  Committed Rap and the Illusion of Historical Pessimism

</h3>
<p>Rap that stands as a spokesperson for the masses, the one that points the finger at the system, perfectly follows the first phase of Leopardi&rsquo;s thought: <strong>Historical Pessimism</strong>.</p>
<p>In this vision, the malaise has an external culprit: society, context, corruption, progress that has distanced man from original happiness. The &ldquo;committed rapper&rdquo; takes charge of this: he becomes a tribune, denounces the social context, looks for visible enemies.
It is a comfortable position, in some ways. It allows those who listen (and those who criticize) to feel on the right side, morally superior. But there is a risk: becoming a spokesperson for a collective malaise can, in the long run, become a pose. You risk telling a pain that you no longer live, transforming the complaint into rhetoric.</p>

  Madame: The Landing at Cosmic Pessimism

<p><img src="madame.jpg" alt="Madame Wild"></p>
<p>On the other side there is a different approach, often mistaken for disengagement, but which in reality is only disillusionment. Artists like <strong>Madame</strong> represent the evolution towards <strong>Cosmic Pessimism</strong>.</p>
<p>Here there is no longer society acting as a scapegoat. As in the mature Leopardi, the fault lies not with the &ldquo;system&rdquo;, but with Nature itself.
Madame sings of impossible loves, of relationships that could save man but fail, not because of external circumstances, but because of the very nature of the human soul, which is made of lack.</p>
<p>Talking about how we love today, telling about neuroses, emptiness and emotional dependencies, does not mean ignoring the world. It means accepting that suffering is an intrinsic condition of existing. Nature (or Fate, or Love) is often a stepmother: she deludes us into thinking we can be complete and then leaves us alone.</p>

  The pain of the individual becomes universal

</h3>
<p>Those who criticize current music because &ldquo;it only talks about itself&rdquo; ignore a fundamental passage: universality always passes through the particular.
Historical pessimism seeks culprits; cosmic pessimism seeks <strong>truth</strong>.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the artist who has the courage to look inside himself and dissect his own pain is more powerful than the one who limits himself to describing the pain of the world from a pulpit. Telling the malaise of individuals, without political filters, is the most honest way to reach everyone.</p>
<p>Because in the end, stripped of social superstructures, man remains naked in front of his nature. And there, as Madame sings synthesizing the concept better than any treatise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Music teaches me that I, I am like the others&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote>
